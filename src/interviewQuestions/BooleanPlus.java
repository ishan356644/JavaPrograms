/***
 * Enum in java is a data type that contains fixed set of constants.

It can be used for days of the week (SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY and SATURDAY) , directions (NORTH, SOUTH, EAST and WEST) etc. The java enum constants are static and final implicitly. It is available from JDK 1.5.

Java Enums can be thought of as classes that have fixed set of constants.

Points to remember for Java Enum
enum improves type safety
enum can be easily used in switch
enum can be traversed
enum can have fields, constructors and methods
enum may implement many interfaces but cannot extend any class because it internally extends Enum class
